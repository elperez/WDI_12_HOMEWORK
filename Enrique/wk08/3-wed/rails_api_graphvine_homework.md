for homework you only need to pick one of the below feature 

# feature 1 - filter out stop words from your histogram

# feature 2 - add button to load comments in the articles show page

- you will need to add a comment model and database table to the app
- you will also need an api endpoint for fetching comments for an article

make an ajax call to fetch comments and build a list of comments from the api endpoint when a user click on the load comments button

- you may want to just seed some comments to make it easier
